"Your memoized algorithm is conceptually correct in that it avoids redundant calculations, a key principle of dynamic programming.  However, the implementation using a hash table to store intermediate results *as you've described it* might not be as energy-efficient as a more straightforward recursive approach with memoization.  Let's analyze why:\n\n**Energy Efficiency Concerns:**\n\n* **Hash Table Overhead:** Hash tables, while offering fast average-case lookups, incur significant overhead.  Each entry requires memory allocation (consuming energy), and hash collisions can lead to slower lookups, increasing energy consumption. The energy cost of memory access is non-negligible, especially for large sets.\n\n* **String Manipulation:** Your algorithm involves substantial string manipulation (concatenation, substring creation).  String operations are computationally expensive and energy-intensive.  Repeated string concatenations, in particular, are inefficient.\n\n* **Memoization Effectiveness:** While memoization reduces redundant computations, the benefit might be smaller than you expect. The advantage of memoization in this problem is most significant for repeated subsets (substrings). Your hash table organization doesn't directly exploit the overlapping subproblem structure as effectively as a more structured memoization approach would.\n\n\n**More Energy-Efficient Approaches:**\n\nA more energy-efficient approach would be to use a bit manipulation-based recursive solution with memoization.  This avoids the overhead of string manipulation:\n\n1. **Bit Representation:** Represent subsets using bit vectors.  For a set of size *n*, a subset can be represented by an *n*-bit integer, where each bit indicates whether the corresponding element is included.\n\n2. **Recursive Generation (with Memoization):**  Recursively generate subsets.  Use an array (or a more efficient data structure like a bitset if your language supports it) as a memoization table. The index of the memoization table would be the bit vector representing a subset.  The value would be a boolean indicating if that subset was already computed.\n\nThis bit manipulation approach minimizes memory allocation (as opposed to creating many strings) and simplifies the computational complexity.  The energy consumption would be dominated by the recursive calls, and the memoization would efficiently eliminate redundant calculations.\n\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nEven with memoization, the time complexity remains O(2<sup>n</sup>). This is inherent to the problem; there are 2<sup>n</sup> subsets of a set with *n* elements. Memoization drastically reduces the *constant factor* but doesn't change the exponential nature of the problem.\n\n**In summary:** While your hash table approach *works*, a bit manipulation-based recursive solution with a simple memoization array would likely be significantly more energy-efficient due to the reduced overhead of string manipulations and hash table operations.  The inherent exponential time complexity remains, but the constant factor is greatly improved.\n"
